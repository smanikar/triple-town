This Triple Town game driver requires Racket version 5.93 or later.


To play manually:

 racket gui.rkt

To play through a server at http://localhost:8080:

 racket gui.rkt http://localhost:8080


The implementation of "gui.rkt" is lightly obfuscated to help you
avoid the temptation to use pieces as a reference implementation.
